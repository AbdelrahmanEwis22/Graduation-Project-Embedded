# Smart Wristband for Health Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a smart wristband that monitors heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. It includes GPS tracking for location monitoring and a SIM card for connectivity. The device is particularly useful for children and elderly people with health concerns. It sends alerts to a connected mobile application in case of irregular readings and allows tracking through a backend system.

## Team Contributions
- **Abdelrahman Ewis**: Responsible for the embedded systems and sensor integration, ensuring seamless communication between the device and the backend.
- **[Adbelrahman And Yousef]**: Developed the backend and mobile application.

## Features
- **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Tracks heart rate and sends alerts for irregular patterns.
- **Blood Pressure Monitoring**: Measures blood pressure and alerts in case of abnormal readings.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Monitors body temperature and sends alerts for fever or hypothermia.
- **GPS Tracking**: Allows real-time location tracking to ensure user safety.
- **SIM Card Connectivity**: Enables remote communication and alert notifications.

## How It Works
The wristband collects health data and transmits it to a backend system via an API. The backend processes the data and sends alerts to a mobile application in case of irregularities.

## Technologies Used
- **Embedded Systems**: For sensor integration.
- **Backend Development**: Handles data processing and alert notifications.
- **API**: Facilitates communication between the wristband and the backend.
